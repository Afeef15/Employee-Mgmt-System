# Employee-Mgmt-System
The ELMS is designed to streamline the leave management process for an organization. It consists of three main modules: Admin, Staff, and Head of Department (HOD). The system allows staff to apply for leave, HODs to approve or reject leave applications, and administrators to manage overall leave records and system settings.
